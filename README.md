# Backcountry Bookings


### Learning Goals:
- Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
- Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented        architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing (Typescript)
- Gain experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec

### Wins + Challenges:
Some challenges included: 
- Successfully implemented glide.js, which can be more technically challenging than others like slider.js
- Created a site using React and Router, the latest technologies that we've learned at Turing
- Stuck to our original layout design despite tricky formatting issues


Some wins included:
- Implementing a several new forms of tech can be tedious as we had to slowly work our way through our notes and documentation, rather than relying on past experience
- Glide.js can be difficult to work with and probably took more time than a different option would have
