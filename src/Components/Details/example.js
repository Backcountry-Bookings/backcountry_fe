Enjoy wide open views of the starry sky or a bright moonlit night. Designated sites are also available in the trees of the foothills, or camping is available in higher forests of Great Sand Dunes National Preserve.

However, sand surface temperatures can soar to 150 degrees F on sunny summer afternoons. Fall is generally mild, with Indian summer days. Highs average in the 60s - 70s F, with chilly nights in the 20s - 30s F. Frigid temperatures are the norm in winter."
