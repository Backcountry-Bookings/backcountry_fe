Along the fifteen mile stretch of the Colorado River between Glen Canyon Dam and Lees Ferry, there are five primitive beaches set aside for camping, marked with signs, on a first-come, first-served basis. Camping is permitted in these areas only, as they are provided with toilets and fire pits. These sites can only be accessed by small vessel. All campsites are located well above the river and require a short walk from your boat.",
